Quote update Pseudocode


def quote_item():
    for item in header:
        increment line item number by 1 and print QTY, MFR, model, description, country of origin, list price, extd amt
        if taa and warranty is wanted, add to description.



model numbers are ALWAYS UNIQUE

classes for brands? could include warranty info, country of origin, manufacturer
could also do classes for quote headers, and use them to autofill excel sheets


want 2 dicts, one for our code, and one for the UI 
    - for user sanity: group things into type -> mfr -> model
    - for the code: everything goes based on type and model number 

need teams implementation to act as the server


quote revision number is added to the end of the quote number, 
    -example: quote 1234 revision 8 is written as quote number '1234.8'
    -first rev of quote is just the 1234

"Job number" should be based on customer ID 
    -example: northrop grumman could have job number NG-001, next grumman job should be NG-002, etc.
    the 4 digit number that is normally used is acually the PO number

    -once po is accepted, increment job num by 1: if NG-001 is accepted, next job number is NG-002




WHEN UPDATING ABOM FROM QUOTE HAVE LINE ITEM BE ANCHOR

add an "include" menu when creating quotes for taa, country of origin, or other accessory info



later add RMA and shipping info
later add "how did you find out about us" section
