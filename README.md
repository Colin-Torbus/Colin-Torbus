- I am fairly new to programming, and have a decent foundation in python, have basic understanding of openpyxl and mysql.connector, and I am currently also learning SQL and MySQL server.
- Currently I am working on database implementation for a new quoting and inventory software for my current workplace.
- I can be reached for business inquiries at c.torbus@electricpicture.com
- For the foreseeable future I will be furthering my knowledge of python and SQL, but want to branch out into c++ and java down the line.
