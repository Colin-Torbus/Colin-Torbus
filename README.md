## Programming Background
I am fairly new to programming, and have a decent foundation in python, have basic understanding of openpyxl and mysql.connector, and I am currently also learning SQL and MySQL server.

### Work
My main role is as an AV Systems Integrator, but have started to branch into a more technical role.
Currently I am working on database implementation for a new quoting and inventory software for my current workplace.
I can be reached for business inquiries at c.torbus@electricpicture.com

### Education and the future.
Currently I am studying for an AS in Information Technology at SNHU, and I am projected to finish by the end of March 2026.
For the foreseeable future I will be furthering my knowledge of python and SQL, but want to branch out into c++ and java down the line.
